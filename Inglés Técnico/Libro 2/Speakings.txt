client:Hello, I have a problem with my bus speed , and I don't now how to resolve it.

manager: Do you use programs that requires many RAM?
 
client: I don't think so , the problem is for example, I have only the browser operating , and 
go very slowly.

Manager: Could you check the hard drive of your computer? If the memory of your computer it's very full 
maybe this could be the problem. In that case I advise you that put part of your files in a output device.

Client: Yes , that's the case . I prove it and that's works. Thank you .
 Manager : Your welcome.
